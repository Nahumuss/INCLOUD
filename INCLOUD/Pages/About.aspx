                    INCLOUD is an acronym to 'Itay Nahum Cloud':
                    <br />
                    it's a storage cloud where you can store your importent stuff
                    <br />
                    and be able to access your files from <b>anywhere</b> around the world.
                    <br />
                    Or if you need a place to backup your files and be sure they are safe.
                    <br />
                    Cloud is a great solotion, but while the free clouds take your information
                    <br />
                    and use your private files. In INCLOUD we make sure they are safe and unknown!

                <p>
                    Before the high-school I was always wondering how can files even go to a 'cloud'.
                    <br />
                    I really didn't know what or where 'cloud' is. When I First Heard about it I thought it was literally in a cloud.
                    <br />
                    Then I thought i was like sitting on the web layer of world or something 😂.
                    <br />
                    Just when I was 14 I found out that the 'cloud' is actually someone's else computer...
                    <br />
                    At this point I really wanted to go into it and since I was told we need to do a website as the yearly project I chose it.
